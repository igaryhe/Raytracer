* Raytracer
** About
This is a Rust implementation of Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". Most of the code just follow Peter's book, and some part of it is inspired by ranveeraggarwal's [[https://github.com/ranveeraggarwal/rust-raytracer][rust-raytracer]], including using Rayon to speedup the rendering process.
** Result
